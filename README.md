# typile

## Motivation

I started studying Typescript. Javascript, which has been free until now, suddenly feels narrow. This situation is a situation where I am not using Typescript coolly.
I will continue to build up daily so that development with Typescript will go smoothly. Piles of Typescript = "Typile".
I hope this sample app helps you get TypeScript to work with any framework.
